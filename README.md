# Platformer (WIP)
A Mario-style platformer written in Python 3.7.x using the Pygame library.

# Physics
- This is not a realistic physics engine, as forces, acceleration, inertia, momentum and other related factors are not implemented, although it is planned for them to be used in future.
- Instead movements directly influence the player's velocity, as does gravity.

# Controls
- A - move left
- D - move right
- SPACE - jump
- CTRL - stop moving
- SHIFT - crouch
